I could not integrate the Monte Carlo simulation into the project. actually i did a lot of research and i understood what it is but i couldn't find how to calculate all the possible options and add it to the project. When I looked at the examples on the web, there were usually examples related to mathematical calculations, such as the areas of the square and circle.
